# dotfiles

My very personal dot-files. 

Of course, you are free to use them in any way but please [let me know](https://github.com/jrobinsonc/dotfiles/issues/new) if you find something wrong or have an improvement you'd like to share.

> WARNING: Please, donâ€™t just take these settings carte blanche; they work for me but might not be the best for you. Use at your own risk. These dot-files are intended to work under macOS Mojave.

## Installation

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
1. Install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html).
1. Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install).
1. Install [Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm).
1. Clone this repo and run `bash ./install.sh`.

You can run the same file `./install` to update your configuration with the latest in the repo. And that also will update your brew's formulae.
